Great question! Let me clarify the relationship between HTTP requests and API requests, as there's often confusion about these terms.HTTP Requests vs API RequestsHTTP requests and API requests aren't opposites - they're related concepts at different levels of abstraction.HTTP RequestsHTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is the underlying communication protocol used on the web. An HTTP request is the technical mechanism for sending data between a client and server.Components of an HTTP request:

Method: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.
URL: The endpoint you're requesting
Headers: Metadata like content type, authentication
Body: Data being sent (for POST, PUT requests)
API Requests
An API request is a higher-level concept - it's a request made to an Application Programming Interface to access specific functionality or data. API requests typically use HTTP as their transport protocol.
Types of APIs:

I've created several modern coupon button designs for your Rails ERB template! Here are 5 different styles:

Elegant Gradient - Smooth gradient with shine effect on hover
Pulsing Glow - Continuously pulsing with glow animation
Ticket-Style - Classic coupon ticket design with bouncing animation
Gradient Flash - Multi-color gradient that cycles through colors
Neon Retro - Cyberpunk-style neon blinking effect

To use these in your Rails ERB template, simply add the CSS to your stylesheet and use one of these class names:
  }
})
Key Differences in Practice
HTTP requests can be made to any web resource (websites, images, files), while API requests specifically target programmatic interfaces designed for data exchange between applications.
HTTP requests focus on the technical protocol details, while API requests focus on the business logic and data being exchanged.
In summary: API requests typically use HTTP as their underlying protocol, so most API requests are actually HTTP requests with specific formatting and endpoints designed for programmatic access.RetryClaude does not have the ability to run the code it generates yet.
