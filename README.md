We are going to cover making HTTP requests from a React application and connecting to a database.
Note: React is a frontend library, so it doesn't connect directly to a database. Instead, we make HTTP requests to a backend server (like Node.js, Express, etc.) that interacts with the database.

Steps:

Setting up a React app.

Making HTTP requests from React to a backend API.

Example of a backend API (for context) that connects to a database.

Since the focus is on React, we'll briefly show how to set up a simple Express server with a database (using MongoDB as an example) and then focus on the React part.

Part 1: React HTTP Requests

We can use the built-in fetch or libraries like axios to make HTTP requests.

Example using fetch:

GET request

POST request

Example using axios:

GET request

POST request

Part 2: Backend Server (Express + MongoDB) for context

We'll create a simple Express server with Mongoose to interact with MongoDB.

Part 3: Connecting React to the Backend

Let's break it down:

Create a React app (using Create React App or any other method).

In the React app, we'll make requests to the backend API.

We'll create a simple component that:

Fetches data from the backend (GET)
I've created several modern coupon button designs for your Rails ERB template! Here are 5 different styles:

Elegant Gradient - Smooth gradient with shine effect on hover
Pulsing Glow - Continuously pulsing with glow animation
Ticket-Style - Classic coupon ticket design with bouncing animation
Gradient Flash - Multi-color gradient that cycles through colors
Neon Retro - Cyberpunk-style neon blinking effect

To use these in your Rails ERB template, simply add the CSS to your stylesheet and use one of these class names:
  }
})
Key Differences in Practice
HTTP requests can be made to any web resource (websites, images, files), while API requests specifically target programmatic interfaces designed for data exchange between applications.
HTTP requests focus on the technical protocol details, while API requests focus on the business logic and data being exchanged.
In summary: API requests typically use HTTP as their underlying protocol, so most API requests are actually HTTP requests with specific formatting and endpoints designed for programmatic access.RetryClaude does not have the ability to run the code it generates yet.
