Great question! Let me clarify the relationship between HTTP requests and API requests, as there's often confusion about these terms.HTTP Requests vs API RequestsHTTP requests and API requests aren't opposites - they're related concepts at different levels of abstraction.HTTP RequestsHTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is the underlying communication protocol used on the web. An HTTP request is the technical mechanism for sending data between a client and server.Components of an HTTP request:

Method: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.
URL: The endpoint you're requesting
Headers: Metadata like content type, authentication
Body: Data being sent (for POST, PUT requests)
API Requests
An API request is a higher-level concept - it's a request made to an Application Programming Interface to access specific functionality or data. API requests typically use HTTP as their transport protocol.
Types of APIs:

REST APIs: Use HTTP methods and follow REST principles
GraphQL APIs: Use HTTP but with a different query structure
SOAP APIs: Use HTTP but with XML messaging
gRPC APIs: Can use HTTP/2 but with different protocols

The Relationship
Most modern web APIs are RESTful APIs that use HTTP as their communication protocol. So when you make an "API request," you're actually making an HTTP request to an API endpoint.
Example: Making an API request using HTTP:
javascript// This is both an HTTP request AND an API request
fetch('https://api.github.com/users/octocat', {
  method: 'GET',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'token your-token-here',
    'Accept': 'application/json'
  }
})
Key Differences in Practice
HTTP requests can be made to any web resource (websites, images, files), while API requests specifically target programmatic interfaces designed for data exchange between applications.
HTTP requests focus on the technical protocol details, while API requests focus on the business logic and data being exchanged.
In summary: API requests typically use HTTP as their underlying protocol, so most API requests are actually HTTP requests with specific formatting and endpoints designed for programmatic access.RetryClaude does not have the ability to run the code it generates yet.
